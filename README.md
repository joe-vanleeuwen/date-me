date-me
=======

[Date Me](http://joe-vanleeuwen.github.io/date-me) is a date-picker with a mobile design. Given today's date, Date Me will setup a date-picker for roughly a year out from today. 
I decided to make this repo as I was working on a custom date-picker for [roominate](https://github.com/joe-vanleeuwen/roominate), a conference room booking app.
